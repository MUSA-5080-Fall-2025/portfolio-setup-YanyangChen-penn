##  Key Concepts Learned (Core Takeaways)

###  Why Visualization Matters (Anscombe’s Quartet)

* **The Big Lesson**: **Summary statistics can hide critical patterns!** Four datasets can have identical means, variances, correlation, and regression lines, but be completely different visually (Anscombe's Quartet). * **Policy Implications**:
    * Outliers often represent **important communities** that algorithms and simple averages might miss.
    * Visual inspection immediately reveals **data quality issues**.

###  Ethical Data Communication

* **The Responsibility**: We must create **honest, transparent visualizations** and **always communicate data quality**.
* **The Failure**: Research shows most planners **fail to report margins of error (MOEs)** and warn users about unreliable data, which violates the AICP Code of Ethics.
* **Real Consequence**: Poor policy decisions are made when data uncertainty is hidden or ignored (e.g., unreliable child poverty estimates used for planning).

## Coding Techniques (R Skills: `ggplot2` & Joins)

### The Grammar of Graphics (`ggplot2`)

Plotting is done by adding layers with `+`. The philosophy is: **Data** $\rightarrow$ **Aesthetics** $\rightarrow$ **Geometries**.

* **Basic Structure**: `ggplot(data = DATA) + aes(x = X, y = Y) + geom_something()`
* **Aesthetics (`aes()`)**: Maps **data variables** to visual properties (e.g., `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, `size`).
* **Geometries (`geom_...()`)**: Defines how data is displayed (e.g., `geom_point()` for scatter, `geom_bar()` for bar charts).

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is detective work aimed at understanding data **before** building models. 
1.  **Visualize Distributions**: Use histograms and boxplots to check for skewness, outliers, or multiple peaks.
2.  **Assess Reliability**: **CRITICAL STEP**. Calculate the Coefficient of Variation (CV) to assess data trustworthiness.

```r
#| label: reliability-cv
# Coefficient of Variation (CV) = MOE / Estimate / 1.645
# CV < 12% is reliable (green)
# CV > 40% is unreliable (red)


 Data Joins (dplyr)
Used to combine separate datasets (e.g., joining income data with education data on a common ID).

Most Common: left_join()

Keeps all rows from the left (first) dataset and adds matching columns from the right dataset.

Crucial Step: Always verify joins by checking the number of rows before and after the join to ensure no data loss or duplication.

 Questions & Challenges (Self-Reflection)
 Ethical Visualization Practice
I must incorporate the 5 Essential Guidelines for Using ACS Data into all my labs:

Report the MOEs.

Include a footnote if MOEs are omitted.

Provide context using CV categories (e.g., "This estimate is unreliable because CV > 40%").

Reduce uncertainty (aggregate data/geographies).

Conduct significance tests for comparisons.

 ggplot2 Nuances
Need more practice separating Aesthetics (inside aes(), uses column names) from Constants (outside aes(), like color = "blue") when building plots.

 Policy Connection
My job is to visually assess data quality (e.g., plotting MOE % vs. Population size to find vulnerable, undercounted communities) and communicate uncertainty clearly, which is an ethical requirement under the AICP Code of Ethics.
