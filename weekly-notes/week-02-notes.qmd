##  Key Concepts Learned (What I Nailed This Week)

###  Algorithmic Decision Making

* **Definition**: Algorithms are rules for solving problems, but in policy, they are programs using data to make **predictions**.
* **The Flaw**: Algorithmic objectivity is an illusion. Every analytical step involves **human choices** (data cleaning, variable selection), which **embed human values and biases** into the data.
* **Case Studies**:
    * **Healthcare Bias**: Algorithm used **cost as a proxy for need**, resulting in lower-cost, high-need Black patients being under-prioritized due to systemic inequities in access.
    * **Criminal Justice**: **COMPAS** was trained on historical arrest data, which reflected **biased policing patterns**, leading to disproportionate risk flags for Black defendants.

### ️ Census Data Foundations

* **Decennial Census (2020)**: **Everyone** counted every 10 years; used for political representation.
* **American Community Survey (ACS)**: Annual survey of **3% of households** providing **detailed data** (income, education, etc.).
    * **5-Year Estimates**: **Most reliable** for small-area policy analysis (e.g., Census Tracts).
* **Geography**: Most policy work is done at the **County** and **Census Tract** (1,500-8,000 people) levels. 
* **Margins of Error (MOE)**: Every ACS estimate has uncertainty. Low MOE percentage relative to the estimate means **more reliable** data.
* **Differential Privacy**: Adding mathematical "noise" to protect individual privacy, creating a trade-off between **privacy and accuracy**.

##  Coding Techniques (New R Skills)

###  Accessing Data with `tidycensus`

We are shifting to the modern, programmatic approach for reproducible data fetching.

```r
#| label: setup-tidycensus
# Load essential packages
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

# Must set the key for programmatic access
census_api_key("YOUR_KEY_HERE")

Questions & Challenges (Self-Reflection)
 Algorithmic Ethics & Proxies
The challenge is consciously avoiding bad proxies (like using cost for need). I need to think critically about data gaps and historical biases in my inputs.

 Data Reliability Rule
I need more practice on the MOE Rule of Thumb to confidently discard data with overlapping error margins or very high MOE percentages.

 Policy Connection
Why MOE Matters: Unreliable data (high MOE) directly threatens algorithmic fairness and professional credibility. Knowing my data quality is the foundation of ethical policy analysis.

Next Steps
Must practice the get_acs() function with different variables and geographies.

Consciously check and report MOE in all analyses to avoid making policy recommendations based on unreliable estimates.

Always ask: "Who might be excluded from my analysis?"
