Pennsylvania census tracts\n# Check that all data loaded correctly\nhead(counties)\nhead(hospitals)\nhead(census_tracts)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many hospitals are in your dataset?  There are 223 hospital in my dataset.\n- How many census tracts?  3345\n- What coordinate reference system is each dataset in? NAD 83\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data \n\nUse `tidycensus` to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.\n\n**Required variables:**\n- Total population\n- Median household income\n- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Get demographic data from ACS\npa_demo <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  state = \"PA\",\n  variables = c(\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\",       # 总人口\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\",   # 家庭收入中位数\n    age_65_66 = \"B01001_020\",       # 男 65-66岁\n    age_67_69 = \"B01001_021\",       # 男 67-69岁\n    age_70_74 = \"B01001_022\",       # 男 70-74岁\n    age_75_79 = \"B01001_023\",       # 男 75-79岁\n    age_80_84 = \"B01001_024\",       # 男 80-84岁\n    age_85_plus = \"B01001_025\",     # 男 85岁+\n    age_65_66_f = \"B01001_044\",     # 女 65-66岁\n    age_67_69_f = \"B01001_045\",     # 女 67-69岁\n    age_70_74_f = \"B01001_046\",     # 女 70-74岁\n    age_75_79_f = \"B01001_047\",     # 女 75-79岁\n    age_80_84_f = \"B01001_048\",     # 女 80-84岁\n    age_85_plus_f = \"B01001_049\"    # 女 85岁+\n  ),\n  geometry = TRUE,\n  year = 2021\n)\n\n# Step 2: Summarize population 65+ ----\npa_demo_clean <- pa_demo |>\n  select(GEOID, variable, estimate) |>\n  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = estimate) |>\n  mutate(\n    pop_65_over = age_65_66 + age_67_69 + age_70_74 + age_75_79 +\n                  age_80_84 + age_85_plus + age_65_66_f + age_67_69_f +\n                  age_70_74_f + age_75_79_f + age_80_84_f + age_85_plus_f\n  ) |>\n  select(GEOID, total_pop, median_income, pop_65_over)\n\n# 查看结果\nhead(pa_demo_clean)\n\n\n\n# Join to tract boundaries\npa_tracts <- tracts(state = \"PA\", cb = TRUE)\n\n# ✅ 正确写法：去掉右侧的几何列再 join\npa_joined <- pa_tracts %>%\n  left_join(st_drop_geometry(pa_demo_clean), by = \"GEOID\")\n\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What year of ACS data are you using?     2021\n- How many tracts have missing income data? 66   \n- What is the median income across all PA census tracts? 65195.5\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations \n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:\n1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\npa_demo_clean <- pa_demo_clean %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_elderly = (pop_65_over / total_pop) * 100\n  )\n\nincome_threshold <- median(pa_demo_clean$median_income, na.rm = TRUE) * 0.8  # 比全州中位数低 20%\nelderly_threshold <- 20\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_demo_clean %>%\n  filter(median_income < income_threshold & pct_elderly > elderly_threshold)\n\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_demo_clean %>%\n  filter(median_income < income_threshold & pct_elderly > elderly_threshold)\n\nnrow(vulnerable_tracts)\nhead(vulnerable_tracts)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?  I chose an income threshold equal to 80% of the statewide median household income (approximately $54,000) to identify tracts that fall substantially below the state’s overall income level.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?     I defined tracts with more than 20% of residents aged 65 and over as having a significant elderly population, since this represents roughly the top quartile of tracts in Pennsylvania in terms of elderly share.\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?    These tracts account for approximately 6.7% of all Pennsylvania census tracts, according to my criteria.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nvul_proj <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, 26918)\nhosp_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, 26918)\n\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(vul_proj)\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroids, hosp_proj)\n\nnearest_dist_m <- apply(dist_matrix, 1, min)\n\nvul_proj <- vul_proj %>%\n  mutate(\n    dist_to_hosp_m = as.numeric(nearest_dist_m),\n    dist_to_hosp_mi = dist_to_hosp_m / 1609.34\n  )\n\navg_dist <- mean(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\nmax_dist <- max(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\nover15 <- sum(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi > 15)\n\navg_dist\nmax_dist\nover15\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts? ≈ 5.8 miles\n- What is the maximum distance? ≈ 27.4 miles\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital 12 tracts\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\nvul_proj <- vul_proj %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = dist_to_hosp_mi > 15\n  )\n\ntable(vul_proj$underserved)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n16\n\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved? \n5.76%\n\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\nIn my opinion I feel confused about the distance we've defined as a undersevred distance.It would be good if we use 10 miles to the defenition of \"undersevrved\".But only about 5.8% of vulnerable census tracts are located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital, indicating that approximately 94%–95% of vulnerable areas are relatively close to hospital facilities.\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n\nvul_proj <- st_transform(vul_proj, st_crs(counties))\ncounties <- st_transform(counties, st_crs(vul_proj))\n\ntracts_with_county <- st_join(vul_proj, counties, join = st_intersects)\n\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\ncounty_summary <- tracts_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%  # 移除几何信息以便聚合\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAME = COUNTY_NAM) %>%  # 如果你的字段叫 COUNTYNAME 或 NAME，请根据实际修改\n  summarise(\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    vulnerable_tracts = sum(!is.na(median_income)),  # 或根据你定义的vulnerable集调整\n    underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (underserved_tracts / total_tracts) * 100,\n    avg_dist_miles = mean(dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\nhead(county_summary)\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n1.PERRY\n2.CLINTON\n3.SULLIVAN\n4.BRADFORD\n5.ACMERON\n\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\ncounty_summary <- tracts_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAME = COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarise(\n    num_vulnerable_tracts = n(),\n    num_underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (num_underserved_tracts / num_vulnerable_tracts) * 100,\n    avg_dist_miles = mean(dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_pop, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_pop = sum(if_else(underserved, total_pop, 0), na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\ncounty_summary %>%\n  mutate(\n    `# Vulnerable Tracts` = num_vulnerable_tracts,\n    `# Underserved Tracts` = num_underserved_tracts,\n    `% Underserved` = percent(pct_underserved / 100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    `Avg. Distance (mi)` = round(avg_dist_miles, 2),\n    `Total Vulnerable Pop.` = comma(total_vulnerable_pop),\n    `Underserved Pop.` = comma(underserved_pop)\n  ) %>%\n  select(\n    County = COUNTY_NAME,\n    `# Vulnerable Tracts`,\n    `# Underserved Tracts`,\n    `% Underserved`,\n    `Avg. Distance (mi)`,\n    `Total Vulnerable Pop.`,\n    `Underserved Pop.`\n  ) %>%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"County-Level Summary of Vulnerable and Underserved Census Tracts in Pennsylvania\"\n  )\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting\n- Include descriptive column names\n- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)\n- Add an informative caption\n- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization \n\nUsing the skills from Week 3 (Data Visualization), create publication-quality maps and charts.\n\n### Map 1: County-Level Choropleth \n\nCreate a choropleth map showing healthcare access challenges at the county level.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(viridis)    \nlibrary(scales)      \n\ncounties_proj <- st_transform(counties, st_crs(vul_proj))\nhospitals_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, st_crs(counties_proj))\n\ncounty_map <- counties_proj %>%\n  left_join(county_summary, by = c(\"COUNTY_NAM\" = \"COUNTY_NAME\"))\n\nggplot() +\n  \n  geom_sf(data = county_map,\n          aes(fill = pct_underserved),\n          color = \"white\", size = 0.3) +\n  \n  geom_sf(data = hospitals_proj,\n          shape = 21, color = \"black\", fill = \"red\", size = 2, alpha = 0.8)+\n\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    name = \"% Underserved Vulnerable Tracts\",\n    option = \"magma\",\n    direction = -1,\n    labels = function(x) paste0(round(x, 1), \"%\")\n  ) +\n  \n   labs(\n    title = \"Healthcare Access Challenges in Pennsylvania\",\n    subtitle = \"Counties colored by percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved (>15 miles from nearest hospital)\",\n    caption = \"Data sources: ACS 2021 (via tidycensus), hospital locations (PA DOH), analysis by Yanyang Chen\"\n  ) +\n\n   theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, margin = margin(b = 8)),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, color = \"gray40\")\n  )\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Fill counties by percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Include hospital locations as points\n- Use an appropriate color scheme\n- Include clear title, subtitle, and caption\n- Use `theme_void()` or similar clean theme\n- Add a legend with formatted labels\n\n---\n\n### Map 2: Detailed Vulnerability Map \n\nCreate a map highlighting underserved vulnerable tracts.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create detailed tract-level map\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ntracts_proj <- st_transform(vul_proj, st_crs(counties))\ncounties_proj <- st_transform(counties, st_crs(tracts_proj))\nhospitals_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, st_crs(tracts_proj))\n\nggplot() +\n  \n  geom_sf(data = counties_proj, fill = NA, color = \"gray60\", size = 0.3) +\n  \n  geom_sf(data = tracts_proj, aes(geometry = geometry),\n          fill = \"lightgray\", color = NA) +\n  \n  geom_sf(data = filter(tracts_proj, underserved == TRUE),\n          aes(geometry = geometry), fill = \"#d73027\", color = NA, alpha = 0.9) +\n  \n  geom_sf(data = hospitals_proj,\n          shape = 21, fill = \"yellow\", color = \"black\", size = 2, alpha = 0.9) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Map 2.

Only a very small portion (<1%) are classified as underserved, mostly on the city’s outer edges.\n\nThis suggests that Philadelphia’s public transit network effectively supports access to polling sites, minimizing transportation barriers for most residents. Future analysis could compare underserved areas with demographic data to identify any equity concerns.\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\nTake a few moments to clean up your markdown document and then write a line or two or three about how you may have incorporated feedback that you recieved after your first assignment. \n\nIncorporation of Feedback\n\nAfter receiving feedback from the first assignment, I focused on improving spatial data organization and clarity in visualization.\nThis time, I made sure to use consistent CRS across all layers, clean up unnecessary warnings, and add clear map annotations to make results easier to interpret.\nI also structured the code more logically and added comments to improve readability.\n---\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\n**What to submit:**\n\n1. **Rendered HTML document posted to your course portfolio** with all code, outputs, maps, and text\n   - Use `embed-resources: true` in YAML so it's a single file\n   - All code should run without errors\n   - All maps and charts should display correctly\n\n**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.html` and `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.qmd`\n\n---\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Assignment Overview\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n- Apply spatial operations to answer policy-relevant research questions\n- Integrate census demographic data with spatial analysis\n- Create publication-quality visualizations and maps\n- Work with spatial data from multiple sources\n- Communicate findings effectively for policy audiences\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations\n\n### Research Question\n\n**Which Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?**\n\nYour analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.\n\n### Required Analysis Steps\n\nComplete the following analysis, documenting each step with code and brief explanations:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Collection (5 points)\n\nLoad the required spatial data:\n- Pennsylvania county boundaries\n- Pennsylvania hospitals (from lecture data)\n- Pennsylvania census tracts\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tigris)\n\n# Load spatial data\ncounties <- st_read(\"E:/Upenn_course/policy/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/lectures/week-04/data/Pennsylvania_County_Boundaries.shp\")\ncensus_api_key(\"940dffa67b928a0518accaf8839aa7b4762b11ab\")\ncensus_tracts <- tracts(state = \"PA\", cb = TRUE)\nhospitals <- st_read(\"E:/Upenn_course/policy/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/MUSA-5080-Fall-2025/lectures/week-04/data/hospitals.geojson\")\n\n# 3.

Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\npa_demo_clean <- pa_demo_clean %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_elderly = (pop_65_over / total_pop) * 100\n  )\n\nincome_threshold <- median(pa_demo_clean$median_income, na.rm = TRUE) * 0.8  # 比全州中位数低 20%\nelderly_threshold <- 20\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_demo_clean %>%\n  filter(median_income < income_threshold & pct_elderly > elderly_threshold)\n\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_demo_clean %>%\n  filter(median_income < income_threshold & pct_elderly > elderly_threshold)\n\nnrow(vulnerable_tracts)\nhead(vulnerable_tracts)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?  I chose an income threshold equal to 80% of the statewide median household income (approximately $54,000) to identify tracts that fall substantially below the state’s overall income level.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?     I defined tracts with more than 20% of residents aged 65 and over as having a significant elderly population, since this represents roughly the top quartile of tracts in Pennsylvania in terms of elderly share.\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?    These tracts account for approximately 6.7% of all Pennsylvania census tracts, according to my criteria.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nvul_proj <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, 26918)\nhosp_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, 26918)\n\ntract_centroids <- st_centroid(vul_proj)\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(tract_centroids, hosp_proj)\n\nnearest_dist_m <- apply(dist_matrix, 1, min)\n\nvul_proj <- vul_proj %>%\n  mutate(\n    dist_to_hosp_m = as.numeric(nearest_dist_m),\n    dist_to_hosp_mi = dist_to_hosp_m / 1609.34\n  )\n\navg_dist <- mean(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\nmax_dist <- max(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\nover15 <- sum(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi > 15)\n\navg_dist\nmax_dist\nover15\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts? ≈ 5.8 miles\n- What is the maximum distance? ≈ 27.4 miles\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital 12 tracts\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\nvul_proj <- vul_proj %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = dist_to_hosp_mi > 15\n  )\n\ntable(vul_proj$underserved)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n16\n\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved? \n5.76%\n\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\nIn my opinion I feel confused about the distance we've defined as a undersevred distance.It would be good if we use 10 miles to the defenition of \"undersevrved\".But only about 5.8% of vulnerable census tracts are located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital, indicating that approximately 94%–95% of vulnerable areas are relatively close to hospital facilities.\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n\nvul_proj <- st_transform(vul_proj, st_crs(counties))\ncounties <- st_transform(counties, st_crs(vul_proj))\n\ntracts_with_county <- st_join(vul_proj, counties, join = st_intersects)\n\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\ncounty_summary <- tracts_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%  # 移除几何信息以便聚合\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAME = COUNTY_NAM) %>%  # 如果你的字段叫 COUNTYNAME 或 NAME，请根据实际修改\n  summarise(\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    vulnerable_tracts = sum(!is.na(median_income)),  # 或根据你定义的vulnerable集调整\n    underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (underserved_tracts / total_tracts) * 100,\n    avg_dist_miles = mean(dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\nhead(county_summary)\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n1.PERRY\n2.CLINTON\n3.SULLIVAN\n4.BRADFORD\n5.ACMERON\n\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\ncounty_summary <- tracts_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAME = COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarise(\n    num_vulnerable_tracts = n(),\n    num_underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (num_underserved_tracts / num_vulnerable_tracts) * 100,\n    avg_dist_miles = mean(dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_pop, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_pop = sum(if_else(underserved, total_pop, 0), na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\ncounty_summary %>%\n  mutate(\n    `# Vulnerable Tracts` = num_vulnerable_tracts,\n    `# Underserved Tracts` = num_underserved_tracts,\n    `% Underserved` = percent(pct_underserved / 100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    `Avg.

Did you need to transform it?\nNAD83 / UTM Zone 18N (EPSG:26918); transformed from WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for meter-based distance analysis.\n\n---\n\n2. **Pose a research question**\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\n\nDo polling places in Philadelphia have adequate access to public transit, and which areas remain underserved by bus routes within a 500-meter distance?\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):**\n- Buffers\n- Spatial joins\n- Spatial filtering with predicates\n- Distance calculations\n- Intersections or unions\n- Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Your spatial analysis\n# ----------------------------\n# Spatial Analysis\n# ----------------------------\n\n# 1️⃣ Spatial Join: Clip polling places within Philadelphia boundary\npolling_philly <- st_join(polling_proj, philly_boundary, join = st_within)\n\n# 2️⃣ Distance Calculation: Find nearest bus stop distance for each polling place\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(polling_philly, bus_stops)\npolling_philly$nearest_dist_m <- apply(dist_matrix, 1, min)\n\n# 3️⃣ Buffer: Identify polling places farther than 500m (underserved)\nbuffer_500m <- st_buffer(bus_stops, 500) # create service area buffer\nserved_area <- st_union(buffer_500m)     # merge all service zones\npolling_philly$underserved <- ifelse(!st_intersects(polling_philly, served_area, sparse = FALSE), 1, 0)\n\n# 4️⃣ Summary table\npolling_summary <- polling_philly %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(underserved) %>%\n  summarise(count = n()) %>%\n  mutate(percentage = round(count / sum(count) * 100, 1))\n\nprint(polling_summary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Analysis requirements:**\n- Clear code comments explaining each step\n- Appropriate CRS transformations\n- Summary statistics or counts\n- At least one map showing your findings\n- Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\n\n**Your interpretation:**\n\nThe spatial analysis reveals that over 99% of polling places in Philadelphia are located within 500 meters of a bus stop, indicating strong transit accessibility to voting locations. Only a very small portion (<1%) are classified as underserved, mostly on the city’s outer edges.\n\nThis suggests that Philadelphia’s public transit network effectively supports access to polling sites, minimizing transportation barriers for most residents. Future analysis could compare underserved areas with demographic data to identify any equity concerns.\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\nTake a few moments to clean up your markdown document and then write a line or two or three about how you may have incorporated feedback that you recieved after your first assignment. \n\nIncorporation of Feedback\n\nAfter receiving feedback from the first assignment, I focused on improving spatial data organization and clarity in visualization.\nThis time, I made sure to use consistent CRS across all layers, clean up unnecessary warnings, and add clear map annotations to make results easier to interpret.\nI also structured the code more logically and added comments to improve readability.\n---\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\n**What to submit:**\n\n1. **Rendered HTML document posted to your course portfolio** with all code, outputs, maps, and text\n   - Use `embed-resources: true` in YAML so it's a single file\n   - All code should run without errors\n   - All maps and charts should display correctly\n\n**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.html` and
