##  Key Concepts Learned (What I Nailed This Week)

::: callout-note
The course philosophy emphasizes that public policy analysis requires focusing on **transparency** and **interpretability** over mere optimization, especially concerning public goods, governance, and equity.

###  The Tidyverse & The Big 5 `dplyr` Verbs

These functions are consistent: the first argument is the data frame, subsequent arguments describe columns (using variable names without quotes), and the output is always a new data frame.

* `**select()**`: Choose columns.
* `**filter()**`: Choose rows.
* `**mutate()**`: Create new variables.
* `**summarize()**`: Calculate statistics (This **collapses rows**).
* `**group_by()**`: Set up grouping (This **does not change rows**, only prepares the data).

### ️ Professional Tools & Workflow

* **Git / GitHub**: A **version control system** and cloud hosting platform. It acts as a **"time machine"** and collaboration tool for code projects.
* **Quarto**: A **publishing system** that combines code, text, and output into professional documents. This is the key to **reproducible research**.
* **Tibbles**: Enhanced data frames used by Tidyverse, featuring smarter printing and display of column types.

##  Coding Techniques (My New Superpowers)

###  The Pipe `%>%` (or `|>`)

The pipe is the magic of `dplyr`. It reads as **"and then..."** and takes the output from the left side, feeding it as the **first argument** to the function on the right.

```r
# The clean, readable pipeline flow:
car_summary <- data %>%
  filter(`Year of manufacture` >= 2020) %>%    # Then, filter
  select(Manufacturer, Model, Price) %>%       # Then, select
  group_by(Manufacturer) %>%                   # Then, group
  summarize(avg_price = mean(Price))           # Then, summarize
