I chose an income threshold equal to 80% of the statewide median household income (approximately $54,000) to identify tracts that fall substantially below the state’s overall income level. - What elderly population threshold did you choose and why? I defined tracts with more than 20% of residents aged 65 and over as having a significant elderly population, since this represents roughly the top quartile of tracts in Pennsylvania in terms of elderly share. - How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria? - What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition? These tracts account for approximately 6.7% of all Pennsylvania census tracts, according to my criteria.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\nYour Task:\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nvul_proj &lt;- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts, 26918)\nhosp_proj &lt;- st_transform(hospitals, 26918)\n\ntract_centroids &lt;- st_centroid(vul_proj)\ndist_matrix &lt;- st_distance(tract_centroids, hosp_proj)\n\nnearest_dist_m &lt;- apply(dist_matrix, 1, min)\n\nvul_proj &lt;- vul_proj %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dist_to_hosp_m = as.numeric(nearest_dist_m),\n    dist_to_hosp_mi = dist_to_hosp_m / 1609.34\n  )\n\navg_dist &lt;- mean(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\nmax_dist &lt;- max(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\nover15 &lt;- sum(vul_proj$dist_to_hosp_mi &gt; 15)\n\navg_dist\n\n[1] 5.151893\n\nmax_dist\n\n[1] 27.78481\n\nover15\n\n[1] 16\n\n\nRequirements: - Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania - Calculate distances in miles - Explain why you chose your projection\nQuestions to answer: - What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts? ≈ 5.8 miles - What is the maximum distance? ≈ 27.4 miles - How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital 12 tracts\n\n\n\nStep 5: Identify Underserved Areas\nDefine “underserved” as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\nYour Task:\n\n# Create underserved variable\nvul_proj &lt;- vul_proj %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = dist_to_hosp_mi &gt; 15\n  )\n\ntable(vul_proj$underserved)\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  262    16 \n\n\nQuestions to answer: - How many tracts are underserved? 16\n\nWhat percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved? 5.76%\nDoes this surprise you? Why or why not? In my opinion I feel confused about the distance we’ve defined as a undersevred distance.It would be good if we use 10 miles to the defenition of “undersevrved”.But only about 5.8% of vulnerable census tracts are located more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital, indicating that approximately 94%–95% of vulnerable areas are relatively close to hospital facilities.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Aggregate to County Level\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\nYour Task:\n\nvul_proj &lt;- st_transform(vul_proj, st_crs(counties))\ncounties &lt;- st_transform(counties, st_crs(vul_proj))\n\ntracts_with_county &lt;- st_join(vul_proj, counties, join = st_intersects)\n\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\ncounty_summary &lt;- tracts_with_county %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%  # 移除几何信息以便聚合\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAME = COUNTY_NAM) %&gt;%  # 如果你的字段叫 COUNTYNAME 或 NAME，请根据实际修改\n  summarise(\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    vulnerable_tracts = sum(!is.na(median_income)),  # 或根据你定义的vulnerable集调整\n    underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (underserved_tracts / total_tracts) * 100,\n    avg_dist_miles = mean(dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\nhead(county_summary)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  COUNTY_NAME total_tracts vulnerable_tracts underserved_tracts pct_underserved\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt;             &lt;int&gt;              &lt;int&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 PERRY                  2                 2                  2           100  \n2 CLINTON                3                 3                  2            66.7\n3 SULLIVAN               3                 3                  2            66.7\n4 BRADFORD               4                 4                  2            50  \n5 CAMERON                6                 6                  3            50  \n6 COLUMBIA               2                 2                  1            50  \n# ℹ 1 more variable: avg_dist_miles &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nRequired county-level statistics: - Number of vulnerable tracts - Number of underserved tracts\n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved - Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts - Total vulnerable population\nQuestions to answer: - Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts? 1.PERRY 2.CLINTON 3.SULLIVAN 4.BRADFORD 5.ACMERON\n\nWhich counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\nAre there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Create Summary Table\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\nYour Task:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\ncounty_summary &lt;- tracts_with_county %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAME = COUNTY_NAM) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    num_vulnerable_tracts = n(),\n    num_underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = (num_underserved_tracts / num_vulnerable_tracts) * 100,\n    avg_dist_miles = mean(dist_to_hosp_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_pop, na.rm = TRUE),\n    underserved_pop = sum(if_else(underserved, total_pop, 0), na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))\n\ncounty_summary %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    `# Vulnerable Tracts` = num_vulnerable_tracts,\n    `# Underserved Tracts` = num_underserved_tracts,\n    `% Underserved` = percent(pct_underserved / 100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    `Avg.

This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question\n\n\nEducation & Youth Services\nOption A: Educational Desert Analysis - Data: Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population) - Question: “Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?” - Operations: Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density - Policy relevance: School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\nOption B: School Safety Zones - Data: Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network - Question: “Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?” - Operations: Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage - Policy relevance: Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice\nOption C: Green Space Equity - Data: Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics) - Question: “Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?” - Operations: Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics - Policy relevance: Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment\n\n\n\nPublic Safety & Justice\nOption D: Crime & Community Resources - Data: Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights - Question: “Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?” - Operations: Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis - Policy relevance: Community investment, violence prevention strategies\n\n\n\nInfrastructure & Services\nOption E: Polling Place Accessibility - Data: Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates) - Question: “Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?” - Operations: Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access - Policy relevance: Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\nOption F: Recreation & Population Health - Data: Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics) - Question: “Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?” - Operations: Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators - Policy relevance: Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n\n\nEmergency Services\nOption G: EMS Response Coverage - Data: Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings - Question: “Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?” - Operations: Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas - Policy relevance: Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n\n\nArts & Culture\nOption H: Cultural Asset Distribution - Data: Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods - Question: “Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?” - Operations: Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups - Policy relevance: Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\nAdditional Sources: - Pennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/ - Census Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns - TIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries\n\n\nRecommended Starting Points\nIf you’re feeling confident: Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers. If you are a beginner, choose something more manageable that helps you understand the basics\nIf you have a different idea: Propose your own question! Just make sure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n\nYour Analysis\nYour Task:\n\nFind and load additional data\n\nDocument your data source\nCheck and standardize the CRS\nProvide basic summary statistics\n\n\n\nroot &lt;- \"E:/Upenn_course/policy/Policy_Assignment_2/data\"\n\n# 文件路径定义（精确版）\npath_polling  &lt;- paste0(root, \"/polling_places.geojson\")\npath_trolley  &lt;- paste0(root, \"/trolley_Stations.geojson\")\npath_regional &lt;- paste0(root, \"/regional_Rail_Stations.geojson\")\npath_hispeed  &lt;- paste0(root, \"/highspeed_Stations.geojson\")\n\n# 检查路径是否存在\ncat(\"Polling:\", file.exists(path_polling), \"\\n\")\n\nPolling: TRUE \n\ncat(\"Trolley:\", file.exists(path_trolley), \"\\n\")\n\nTrolley: TRUE \n\ncat(\"Regional:\", file.exists(path_regional), \"\\n\")\n\nRegional: TRUE \n\ncat(\"Highspeed:\", file.exists(path_hispeed), \"\\n\")\n\nHighspeed: TRUE \n\n# 读取\npolling  &lt;- st_read(path_polling, quiet = TRUE)\ntrolley  &lt;- st_read(path_trolley, quiet = TRUE)\nregional &lt;- st_read(path_regional, quiet = TRUE)\nhispeed  &lt;- st_read(path_hispeed, quiet = TRUE)\n\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(sf)\n  library(tidyverse)\n  library(readr)\n})\n\nroot &lt;- \"E:/Upenn_course/policy/Policy_Assignment_2/data\"\n\npath_polling  &lt;- file.path(root, \"polling_places.geojson\")\npath_trolley  &lt;- file.path(root, \"trolley_Stations.geojson\")\npath_regional &lt;- file.path(root, \"regional_Rail_Stations.geojson\")\npath_hispeed  &lt;- file.path(root, \"highspeed_Stations.geojson\")\npath_gtfs_bus &lt;- file.path(root, \"gtfs_public/google_bus/stops.txt\")\n\npolling  &lt;- st_read(path_polling, quiet = TRUE)\ntrolley  &lt;- st_read(path_trolley, quiet = TRUE)\nregional &lt;- st_read(path_regional, quiet = TRUE)\nhispeed  &lt;- st_read(path_hispeed, quiet = TRUE)\n\nstops_df &lt;- read_csv(path_gtfs_bus, show_col_types = FALSE)\nbus_stops &lt;- stops_df %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(stop_lon), !is.na(stop_lat)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"stop_lon\", \"stop_lat\"), crs = 4326)\n\nall_stops_wgs84 &lt;- bind_rows(\n  bus_stops %&gt;% select(geometry),\n  trolley  %&gt;% st_zm() %&gt;% select(geometry),\n  regional %&gt;% st_zm() %&gt;% select(geometry),\n  hispeed  %&gt;% st_zm() %&gt;% select(geometry)\n)\n\nproj_crs &lt;- 26918\npolling_proj   &lt;- st_transform(polling, proj_crs)\nall_stops_proj &lt;- st_transform(all_stops_wgs84, proj_crs)\n\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(sf)\n  library(tidyverse)\n  library(ggplot2)\n})\n\n# ----------------------------\n# 1. 提取费城市界\n# ----------------------------\nphilly_boundary &lt;- counties %&gt;%\n  filter(COUNTY_NAM == \"Philadelphia\")\n\n# ----------------------------\n# 2. 读取公交站点并筛选费城范围\n# ----------------------------\nstops_df &lt;- read_csv(\n  \"E:/Upenn_course/policy/Policy_Assignment_2/data/gtfs_public/google_bus/stops.txt\",\n  show_col_types = FALSE\n)\n\n# 自动判断列名\nif (\"stop_lat\" %in% names(stops_df) & \"stop_lon\" %in% names(stops_df)) {\n  bus_stops &lt;- st_as_sf(stops_df, coords = c(\"stop_lon\", \"stop_lat\"), crs = 4326)\n} else {\n  bus_stops &lt;- st_as_sf(stops_df, coords = c(\"stop_lat\", \"stop_lon\"), crs = 4326)\n}\n\n# 转换为米制并打印坐标范围\nbus_stops &lt;- st_transform(bus_stops, 26918)\nprint(summary(st_coordinates(bus_stops)))\n\n       X                Y          \n Min.   :428729   Min.   :4406078  \n 1st Qu.:476765   1st Qu.:4422717  \n Median :485018   Median :4428790  \n Mean   :483162   Mean   :4429572  \n 3rd Qu.:489725   3rd Qu.:4435632  \n Max.   :520914   Max.   :4464839  \n\n# ----------------------------\n# 3. 统一投票点 CRS\n# ----------------------------\npolling_proj &lt;- st_transform(polling_proj, 26918)\nbus_stops &lt;- st_transform(bus_stops, 26918)\nphilly_boundary &lt;- st_transform(philly_boundary, 26918)\n\n# ----------------------------\n# 4. 计算投票点到最近公交站的距离（米）\n# ----------------------------\nnearest_dist &lt;- st_distance(polling_proj, bus_stops)\npolling_proj$nearest_dist_m &lt;- apply(nearest_dist, 1, min)\n\n# ----------------------------\n# 5. 定义 underserved（&gt;500m 视为交通不可达）\n# ----------------------------\npolling_proj$underserved &lt;- ifelse(polling_proj$nearest_dist_m &gt;

Only a very small portion (&lt;1%) are classified as underserved, mostly on the city’s outer edges.\nThis suggests that Philadelphia’s public transit network effectively supports access to polling sites, minimizing transportation barriers for most residents. Future analysis could compare underserved areas with demographic data to identify any equity concerns."

Overall Pattern Identification: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses? 2. Equity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. Root Cause Analysis: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk? 4. Strategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\nExecutive Summary:\nSome systematic patterns across all analyses is that the minority population is immensely small compared to the overwhelming majority of 90% white. The MOE has been consistently higher, which has led to some tracts within both counties to have a population estimate of 0, indicating a small sample size.\nBoth the black and LatinX communities face algorithmic biased simply because their population is so small, meaning there is likely to be a greater margin of error."
